	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This site was implemented in support of a graduate project researching the impact of data visualization. The topic of term limits is being
	used as the topic is currently drawing great attention and there are very few visualizations available that describe the impact of implmenting
	various term limit lengths. Congressional term information is displayed in various visual manners and the viewer can select a desired
	term limit and visualize the effects of their selection.</p>
	<h2>Details</h2>
	<h3>Browser support</h3>
	<p>This site uses advanced web features, such as canvas, requiring a fairly modern browser to work properly. Minimum browser requirements are 
	Chrome version 43, Safari version 9, IE 9, etc. A complete list of supported browsers is available at <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas">caniuse.com</a></p>
	<h3>Categorization</h3>
	<p>States are classified into 5 categories based on the relative depth of their legislators' time over the desired term limit. This categorization
	is displayed by associating different colors for each category. The deeper past the desired term limit, the darker the state is colored. The color schemes were
	selected using the <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">colorbrewer for cartography</a> site.</p>
	<h3>Categorization algorithm</h3>
	<p>The goal of the algorithm is to show the relative depth of totality of a given state's legislators whose tenure is past the desired term limit. For each state, a value
	is computed which is the total overage for all legislators shown as a percentage of the total allowed time under the desired limit.</p>
	<p>The results of the algorithm are the basis for selecting colors from the color palette which in turn are used when displaying states.</p>
	<h3>Options</h3>
	<p>Options can be changed by moving the "slider" at the top of data pages or clicking on the menu "gear" symbol. Available options are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Color palette</strong>, which is changed be selecting the "gear symbol". A palette is a selection of colors applied to states shown in maps and tables.</li>
		<li><strong>Desired term limit</strong>, changed by moving the slider or directly selecting a term from the dropdown box. The term limit length cannot be set lower than 6 years,
		which is the length of a single senate term. Setting the term lower than 6 years would make all states non-compliant, which makes the visualization meaningless.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Source of data</h3>
	<p>The legislator data used in this site was extracted from the <a href="http://theunitedstates.io">@unitedstates project</a>, which is a site dedicated
	to open government data.</p>
